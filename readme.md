### Why did I do it?

I do freelance translation work in the computer software & hardware industry, so IBM Glossary would be very useful to me. I use the CAT tool OmegaT to aid me in the translation, so this script was made with OmegaT in mind.

### What does it do?

Scraps all glossary words and their definitions from [IBM Glossary](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/terminology/) and organizes the data into a .txt file readable by OmegaT, this is becasue OmegaT reads a glossary text file following a simple format: words and their definitions must be separated by tabs (`\t`).
